Net/EMI/Common
==============

This module contains a number of routines that are used by an EMI client class and
that will most likely be useful if someone choses to implement an EMI server class or two.

When designing the Net::EMI::Client class, it just seemed so natural to put these routines
in a module of their own, to actively encourage code reuse.
